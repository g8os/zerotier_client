# zerotier_client
client to zerotier network generated by [go-raml](https://github.com/Jumpscale/go-raml)

## Guides

### central-api.md
Is zerotier API specification from https://my.zerotier.com/static/central-api.md

### api.raml
RAML file converted from central-api.md.
Currently we didn't find any converted that produce a usable raml formated file out of the box. So this raml file has been converted manually.

## example.py

An example on how to use the library. It does these things:

- print network status
- get array of networks and print the name of first network in the array
- reverse the name of the first network above
- get the first network above by it's ID and print it's name
- creates new network with name = 'my new network'

## generates.sh
Script to generate this client library using [go-raml](https://github.com/Jumpscale/go-raml) from the api.raml file.
